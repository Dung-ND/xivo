# XIVO: X Inertial-aided Visual Odometry and Sparse Mapping


![Demo](misc/demo_ucla_e6.gif)

XIVO is an open-source repository for visual-inertial odometry/mapping. It is a simplified version of Corvis \[[Jones *et al.*][jones_ijrr11],[Tsotsos *et al.*][tsotsos_icra15]\], designed for pedagogical purposes, and incorporates odometry (relative motion of the sensor platform), local mapping (pose relative to a reference frame of the oldest visible features), and global mapping (pose relative to a global frame, including loop-closure and global re-localization â€” this feature, present in Corvis, is not yet incorporated in XIVO).

XIVO runs at 140FPS on stored data (here from a RealSense D435i sensor) or on live streams with latency of around 1-7ms, depending on the hardware. It takes as input video frames from a calibrated camera and inertial measurements from an IMU, and outputs a sparse point cloud with attribute features and 6 DOF pose of the camera. It performs auto-calibration of the relative pose between the camera and the IMU as well as the time-stamp alignment. More demos are available [here](demo.md), the aproach is described in this [paper][tsotsos_icra15]. XIVO does not perform post-mortem refinement (bundle adjustment, pose graph optimization), but that can be easily added as post-processing.


## Requirements

This software is primarily built and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with compiler g++9. We may support other platforms as we feel like. A full list of supported platforms is listed in our [build page](https://github.com/ucla-vision/xivo/wiki/Build-Instructions).


## Dependencies

- [OpenCV][opencv]: Feature detection and tracking.
- [Eigen][eigen]: Linear algebra.
- [Pangolin][pangolin]: Lightweight visualization.
- [glog][glog]: Logging.
- [gflags][gflags]: Command-line options.
- [jsoncpp][jsoncpp]: Configuration.
- (optional) [googletest][gtest]: Unit tests.
- (optional) [g2o][g2o]: To use pose graph optimization.
- (optional) [ROS][ros]: To use in live mode with ROS.
- (optional) [pybind11][pybind11]: Python binding.
<!-- - [abseil-cpp][absl]: General utilities. -->

All dependencies, except for OpenCV, are included in the `thirdparty` directory.
